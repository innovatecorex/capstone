/**
 * Fix two RESTRICT foreign keys that prevent user deletion:
 *
 *   attendance.recorded_by  → was RESTRICT (no rule = MySQL default)
 *   assessments.posted_by   → was RESTRICT (constrained() with no onDelete)
 *
 * Both become SET NULL so that deleting a user preserves historical rows
 * but clears the actor reference. Orphaned values (pointing to deleted
 * users) are nulled out before the FK is re-applied.
 *
 * Uses raw SQL throughout to avoid Doctrine (removed in Laravel 11) and
 * to guarantee the correct ALTER → UPDATE → ADD FOREIGN KEY order.
